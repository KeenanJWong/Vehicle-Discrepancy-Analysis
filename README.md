# Vehicle_Discr
Repository for Vehicle Issue Discrepancy project <br />
<br />


* Problem statement: 
**The Vehicle System Log, which records all errors that the vehicle encounters, has been stated to inaccurately record 'Issue 1' as 'Issue 2'. 
Analysis to highlight the scale of inaccuracy is required to justify the business case in order for the Maintenance team to allocate resources. 



* Methodology: 
**Datasets from a sample period (1/1/2022 to 1/1/2023) were extracted for comparison:
***First Dataset: 
**** Data from the Machine performance log. 
**** This data is allows us f

** From the Machine performance logs, we are able to extract timestamps where certain conditions are met to indicate 'Issue 1'.




By looking into the Vehicle machine log we are able to map out all the indications of 'Issue 1' and the time stamps
** We then compare the time stamps of the 'Issue 1' indications to what is recorded in the Vehicle System log.
***From there we can see which records in the Vehicle system log were recorded as an incorrect issue and not 'Issue 1'.

*Tools used: Python, Excel
