Repository for Vehicle Issue Discrepancy project <br />
<br />


* Problem statement: 

* Analysis was done to identify discrepancy in the Vehicle System Log.

* Methodology: By looking into the Vehicle machine log we are able to map out all the indications of 'Issue 1' and the time stamps
** We then compare the time stamps of the 'Issue 1' indications to what is recorded in the Vehicle System log.
***From there we can see which records in the Vehicle system log were recorded as an incorrect issue and not 'Issue 1'.

*Tools used: Python, Excel
